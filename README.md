SMAA (enhanced subpixel morphological antialiasing) for Unity.

  - Base code, paper & slides : [Jorge Jimenez, Jose I. Echevarria, Tiago Sousa, Diego Gutierrez](http://www.iryoku.com/smaa/)
  - Initial Unity port : [Damon Wall](https://github.com/m10914/SMAA-Unity)

This effect requires **Unity Pro** (tested on Unity 4+) and a **SM3.0 compatible GPU**.

To use it, copy the **SMAA** folder to your project, drop **SMAA.cs** on your camera and **SMAAshader** into its Shader field.
